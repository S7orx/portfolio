I'm [Sahar Awaji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-sahar-awaji-phd-a82537b1/), a PhD student at the University of Central Florida. When I was pursuing my PhD, I was focused on integrating social physics, computational modeling, and statistics to understand social change. For a list of my publications, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or you can review my [CV](https://github.com/SaharAwaji/personal-website/blob/main/CV.pdf).
